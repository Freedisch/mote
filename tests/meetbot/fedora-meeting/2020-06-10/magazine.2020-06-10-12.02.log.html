<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">12:28:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysoplab&gt;</span> Not sure why it's split.  If you're going to review it might as well propose edits at the same time
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">12:28:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;asamalik&gt;</span> review is for the author to indicate they're done, anbd edit is for the editors to confirm it's ready
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">12:28:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;asamalik&gt;</span> or they can move it to in progress and ask for tweaks

<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">12:43:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bcotton&gt;</span> so asamalik's proposal was that we'd start tomorrow

<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">12:43:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysoplab&gt;</span> So should all current proposals in pajure that I can't close be moved over at that time?

<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">12:44:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bcotton&gt;</span> do we still want to start tomorrow or should we push back a bit in order to figure out our plan
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">12:44:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;asamalik&gt;</span> sorry I haven't had chance to look at this since my last message on the list
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">12:44:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysoplab&gt;</span> Is it already ready and we just need to use it?  Is the board that's paying for it okay with the plan (asamalik was going to ask I think)
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">12:45:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;asamalik&gt;</span> maybe let's push it a week?
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">12:45:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bcotton&gt;</span> we'll send a post to the mailing list and update the docs to point to the new location. the mailing list won't go away for now, so we'll probably have to redirect folks as they come along
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">12:45:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bcotton&gt;</span> we're not going to be a meaningful increase in the usage. adam and i are on the council and we both agree we should just start using it and if it becomes a problem we can deal with it then
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">12:45:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gregbartholomew&gt;</span> oh boy, more redirect! :)
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">12:46:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysoplab&gt;</span> It was noted that discource has a mailing list feature..any way someone could add the discourse to the current mailing list address instead of redirecting.

<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">12:56:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bcotton&gt;</span> i think it's a good idea, and we can probably find some interesting stuff to publish
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">12:56:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bcotton&gt;</span> :-D
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">12:56:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bcotton&gt;</span> i can take doing a first pass of stats, etc and then sharing that with the mailing list unless someone else really wants to :-)

<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">12:57:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sysoplab&gt;</span> Can show the trending fairly consistantly

<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">12:58:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jakfrost&gt;</span> to?
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">12:58:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bcotton&gt;</span> i figure, editors, writers, comments, page views, and uniques are all good things to mine for stats
